	abstract = {The fuel cycle performance and core design of the Transatomic Power liquid-fueled molten salt reactor concept is analyzed. This advanced reactor concept uses configurable zirconium hydride moderator rod assemblies to shift the neutron spectrum in the core from intermediate at beginning of life to thermal at end of life. With a harder spectrum during the early years of reactor operation, this spectral shift design drives captures in fertile 238U. The converted fissile plutonium makes up over 50\% of the fissile material in the fuel salt over the last half (∼15 years) of reactor operation. A softer spectrum late in reactor life helps drive the fuel to a burnup of 90 GWd/MTU. Continuously changing physics necessitates time-dependent analyses resolved over long timescales (i.e., months to years), as this concept does not meet an equilibrium condition. The spectral shift and molten salt reactor material feeds and removals enable this concept to perform better in fuel cycle metrics, increasing resource utilization by more than 50\% compared with a typical light water reactor (i.e., from ∼0.6\% to ∼1\%). These metrics are compared to similar fuel cycles using alternate technologies. Additional core design and analysis challenges associated with the spectral shift and use of molten salt reactor technology are identified and discussed.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor (MSR) shows great promise of high thermal-electric conversion efficiency, inherent safety, and on-line reprocessing. Furthermore, fuel breeding can be realized in both thermal and fast spectrum reactors with Th-U fuel cycle, which can make use of the abundant resource of thorium. In order to combine the advantages of high breeding ratio (BR) in fast spectrum and low fissile inventory for criticality in thermal spectrum, a single-fluid double-zone thorium-based molten salt reactor (SD-TMSR) core configuration is proposed. First, assemblies in both the inner and the outer zones are optimized by adjusting the ratios of molten salt and graphite with consideration of BR, 233U inventory, double time (DT), and temperature coefficient of reactivity (TCR) at the startup time, aiming to have a minimal DT for fuel breeding and a negative TCR for security. The results show that DT has the optimum value when the ratios of molten salt and graphite in the inner zone and the outer zone are 0.357 and 1.162, respectively. And the TCR can be improved to −2 pcm/K when the side length of the graphite hexagonal prism is 7.5 cm. Then, based on the optimized geometry, the burn-up calculations with a series of on-line reprocessing rates are carried out with a self-developed MSR reprocessing sequence (MSR-RS). The results show that on-line reprocessing is beneficial to the Th-U fuel breeding. When the reprocessing rate is 200 l/d, iso-breeding can be achieved. When the reprocessing rate is 5 m3/d, the performance of Th-U breeding is improved significantly, and only 16 years is needed for the 233U doubling. The results also show that TCR remains negative and inherent safety is satisfied during all the operation time.},

	abstract = {We discuss here the concept of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor dedicated to future nuclear energy production. The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the MSBR project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo MCNP code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a MSBR-like reference system with 232Th/233U fuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with theplutonium from PWR spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232Th/233U MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233U production in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with 233U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with 232Th/233U fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor (MSR) has fascinating features: inherent safety, no fuel fabrication, online fuel reprocessing, etc. However, the graphite moderated MSR may present positive feedback coefficient which has severe implications for the transient behavior during operation. In this paper, the feedback coefficient and the breeding ratio are optimized based on the fuel-to-graphite ratio variation for a thorium based MSR (TMSR). A certain thermal core with negative feedback coefficient and relative high initial breeding ratio is chosen for the reprocessing scheme analysis. The breeding performances for the TMSR under different online fuel reprocessing efficiencies and frequencies are evaluated and compared with other MSR concepts. The results indicate that the thermal TMSR can get a breeding ratio greater than 1.0 with appropriate reprocessing scheme. The low fissile inventory in thermal TMSR leads to a short doubling time and low transuranic (TRU) inventory. The lifetime of graphite used for the TMSR is also discussed.},
